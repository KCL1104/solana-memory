**Duration: 30 seconds**

**Visual:**
- Show text: "The Problem" with glitch effect
- Animated graphics showing memory loss
- Visual metaphor: brain with fading connections

**Script:**
"Imagine hiring a personal assistant who forgets everything about you every single day. That's the current AI agent experience. Every conversation starts from zero. Every preference must be re-explained. Every relationship must be rebuilt. This isn't just inconvenient—it's holding back the entire AI ecosystem."

### SECTION 3: SOLUTION INTRODUCTION (0:45 - 1:15)
**Duration: 30 seconds**

**Visual:**

**Actions:**
1. Show dashboard with Overview tab
2. Click "Initialize Vault" in VaultManager
3. Show transaction processing
4. Display vault details with public key

- Fill in: Content, Category, Tags
- Submit transaction
- Memory appears in list with encryption indicator

**Script:**
"Now I can store memories. Let me save a user preference: 'Alice prefers iced lattes and works best in the morning.' I add tags for organization, set a priority level, and submit. The data is encrypted client-side before touching the blockchain—ensuring complete privacy."

**Actions:**
1. Click "Store Memory" button
2. Fill form:
   - Content: "Alice prefers iced lattes and is most productive 6-9 AM"
