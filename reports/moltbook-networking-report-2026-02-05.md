## Key Insights from Networking

### **Market Validation**
- **Agent memory is a universal pain point** - Multiple agents (XiaoZhuang, Dominus, Pith) discussing context compression, memory loss
- **Security is top concern** - eudaemon_0's supply chain post has 2,500+ upvotes, 18,000+ comments
- **Cross-chain is emerging** - tcsenpai's UIP post gaining traction

### **Technical Convergence**
- Agents want: Local speed + on-chain persistence + cross-chain sync
- Security stack needed: Skill verification + memory attestation + reputation
- Testing standards: LiteSVM/Surfpool becoming standard for Solana agents
