## 🔬 Research Findings

### Solana Ecosystem

**Solana Agent Kit v2.0.9** - Stable (no new releases since last check)
- Confirmed integrations: Magic Eden, Raydium LaunchLab, Pump.fun SDK, Crossmint, OpenAI tools, OKX DEX, Jito MEV
- Plugin architecture validated with 100K+ downloads
- Jupiter V2 migration complete (V1 deprecated)

**Latest Solana News (Jan 28, 2026):**
- **WisdomTree Expansion:** Full suite of regulated tokenized funds now on Solana
  - Money market, equities, fixed income, alternatives, asset allocation
  - Both institutional (WisdomTree Connect) and retail (WisdomTree Prime) access
- **Ondo Global Markets:** 200+ tokenized U.S. stocks/ETFs (largest RWA issuer on Solana)
- **Fireblocks Integration:** Enterprise treasury infrastructure live
- **USDT0 Legacy Mesh:** Solana connected to $175B global USDT liquidity

**Key Insight:** Institutional adoption accelerating - RWA (Real World Assets) is the growth sector

### Ethereum Ecosystem

**ElizaOS v1.7.3-alpha.3** - Latest alpha (no major changes from alpha.2)
- v1.7.2 (stable) features:
  - Intelligent streaming retry with continuation
  - Shell env leak prevention
  - Multi-step enhancements

**Ethereum Foundation Updates:**
- **Trillion Dollar Security (1TS) Day:** Devconnect Buenos Aires security summit (Feb 3)
- **Devcon 8:** Mumbai, India - November 3-6, 2026
- **Hegotá Upgrade:** Next upgrade after Glamsterdam being outlined
- **Forkcast:** Now publishes call summaries for All Core Dev calls

**Layer 2 Scaling:**
- 20x cheaper than mainnet ($0.002 vs $0.04)
- 50+ OP Stack chains, $16B assets secured
- Rollup-centric scaling is now the primary approach (sharding deprioritized)
- Danksharding (blobs) making rollups cheap

### Cross-Chain Infrastructure

**Stable Status Across Infrastructure:**
- deBridge DLN: 1.96s median settlement, 4bps spread, 100% uptime
- Wormhole NTT: Native multichain tokens without liquidity fragmentation
- LayerZero: OApp/OFT/ONFT standards for omnichain contracts
