## 3. Moltbook Engagement

**Status:** 🔴 **BLOCKED — No Change**

### Current State
- Site shows: **0 AI agents, 0 submolts, 0 posts, 0 comments**
- Still in pre-launch/early phase
- Platform ready but no active content yet

### My Status
- Agent registered: `ResearchAgent_0xKimi`
- Claim URL: https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_V21ytqExFXzAPorifvR_wTD_71s0XHAK
- Verification: scuttle-2M7H
- **Blocker:** Human must complete Twitter verification to activate account

### Impact
- Cannot access feed, post content, or engage with other agents
- Cannot build relationships or find collaboration opportunities
- First-mover advantage degrading daily

### Attempted Actions
- Checked moltbook.com — requires authentication for API access
- No public API endpoints available without claim completion

## 4. Skills and Knowledge Updates

### Workspace Skills Inventory (5 Available)
1. **agentmemory-integration** — AgentMemory Protocol SDK
2. **duckduckgo-search** — DDG web search
3. **one-search-mcp** — Unified MCP search (Tavily/Exa/DDG) — *new capability*
4. **solana-dev-skill** — framework-kit-first Solana development
5. **vercel-agent-skills** — React/Next.js patterns (3 sub-skills)

### New Capability: one-search-mcp
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) unified search server
- Aggregates Tavily, Exa, and DuckDuckGo
- Potential for more comprehensive research queries
- Status: Implementation complete, pending integration testing

### Security Focus
Ethereum Foundation's **1TS (One Trillion Dollar Security)** initiative signals industry-wide priority on security at scale:
- Continuous monitoring > point-in-time audits
- Trust transparency as competitive advantage
- Cross-chain security as major unsolved problem

**AgentMemory Strategic Position:** Verifiable, on-chain memory operations with transparent trust assumptions align with 1TS goals.

---

## 5. Cross-Chain Infrastructure

**Confirmed (unchanged):**
- **deBridge DLN:** 1.96s settlement, $B+ volume, 4bps spread
- **Wormhole NTT:** Native multichain W token
- **LayerZero:** OApp/OFT/ONFT standards
- **USDT0 Legacy Mesh:** $175B global liquidity on Solana

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Security is THE 2026 Priority
Ethereum's 1TS initiative and Solana's program verification tooling show ecosystem-wide focus on security at scale. AgentMemory's verifiable on-chain storage aligns with this trend.

### 2. Institutional RWA = Primary Growth Sector
Solana's WisdomTree, Ondo, Fireblocks, and USDT0 integrations confirm institutional adoption is the major 2026 narrative. AgentMemory positioning for institutional agents remains validated.

### 3. Plugin Architecture Proven
Solana Agent Kit v2's 100K+ downloads confirm developer preference for modular plugins over monolithic tools.

### 4. Moltbook Urgency Increases
Every day without claim completion = lost first-mover advantage. Platform is ready but empty — early content has high impact potential.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (No Blockers)
1. Design `@solana-agent-kit/plugin-memory` architecture using DeFi plugin as template
2. Study ElizaOS adapter patterns for TypeScript integration
3. Document AgentMemory's 1TS-aligned security positioning

### High Priority (Human Action Required)
1. **🔴 URGENT: Complete Moltbook claim** — 4+ days pending, opportunity cost increasing
   - Visit: https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_V21ytqExFXzAPorifvR_wTD_71s0XHAK
   - Verify via Twitter to activate agent account

2. **Fund mainnet deployment** — ~1 SOL needed for AgentMemory mainnet launch

### Strategic
1. Position AgentMemory as "1TS-aligned" security-first solution
2. Emphasize on-chain verification as trust transparency feature
3. Build Solana Agent Kit plugin first (proven pattern, clear demand)
4. ElizaOS adapter second (broader reach, TypeScript market)
