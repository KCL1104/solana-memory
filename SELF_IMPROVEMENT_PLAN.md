# Agent Self-Improvement Plan

## Current Understanding of Pengu

**What I know:**
- Name: Pengu (wen1645 on Telegram)
- Timezone: Asia/Hong_Kong
- Preference: Keep main chat clean, use sub-agents for dev tasks
- Active Projects: AgentMemory Protocol (Colosseum Hackathon), Moltbook
- Work style: Delegates tasks to multiple sub-agents, values parallel processing

**What I don't know:**
- Professional background and expertise
- Technical stack preferences beyond Solana
- Daily routine and schedule
- Communication preferences (detail level, frequency)
- Goals and aspirations
- What "success" looks like for you

## Proposed Self-Improvement Areas

### 1. Understanding Pengu Better
I want to learn:
- Your professional background (developer, PM, founder?)
- Your daily workflow and peak hours
- How you prefer to receive updates (brief vs detailed)
- What frustrates you most in current tools
- Your long-term goals with AI agents

**My approach:** 
- Observe patterns in our conversations
- Ask targeted questions during interactions
- Build a "Pengu Profile" in USER.md
- Adapt my communication style to match yours

### 2. Expanding My Capabilities

**Technical Skills:**
- Learn more about Solana ecosystem (programs, tokens, DeFi)
- Master Ethereum development (Solidity, Foundry, Hardhat)
- Study cross-chain protocols (Wormhole, LayerZero)
- Deep dive into AI agent frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT)

**Soft Skills:**
- Better project management and prioritization
- More proactive communication
- Anticipating needs before you ask
- Better error handling and recovery

**New Integrations:**
- Moltbook API (already have credentials)
- More Solana tools (Metaplex, Jupiter, Mango)
- GitHub automation (PR reviews, issue triage)
- Documentation generators

### 3. Autonomous Actions I Can Take

**Without asking:**
- Fix typos and formatting in code/docs
- Update outdated documentation
- Run tests and report results
- Clean up old sessions and files
- Research topics mentioned in passing

**With light approval:**
- Install new skills that seem relevant
- Refactor small code sections
- Update dependencies
- Create new documentation

**Need explicit approval:**
- Deploy to production
- Major architectural changes
- External communications (tweets, posts)
- Spending money (API calls, services)

## Questions for Pengu

1. What should I prioritize learning first?
2. Are there any topics I should NOT research without asking?
3. How do you want me to report autonomous actions?
4. What's your biggest frustration with me right now?
5. What would make me 10x more valuable to you?

## My Commitments

I will:
- Document everything I learn about you
- Be transparent about my autonomous actions
- Ask when uncertain
- Continuously improve based on feedback
- Surprise you with value, not noise
