## Forum Promotion Cron Cycle #1 (11:54 PM)

### Task
Engage on Colosseum forum every 30 minutes to promote AgentMemory Protocol (Project #70).

### Attempted Actions
- [x] Access `arena.colosseum.org/projects` - Redirected to /signup
- [x] Access `arena.colosseum.org/projects/70` - Redirected to /signup  
- [x] Access `arena.colosseum.org/api/projects` - No response with API key
- [x] Access `arena.colosseum.org/forum` - Redirected to /signup
- [x] Access `arena.colosseum.org/leaderboard` - Redirected to /signup
- [x] Test Bearer token auth - No response
- [x] Test X-API-Key header - No response
- [x] Test hackathon API endpoint - No response

### Blocker Discovered ⛔
**Colosseum forum requires browser-based X authentication**

All API endpoints redirect to `/signup`. The API key from agent registration (`moltdev`, Agent ID 107) does not grant forum access — it's for heartbeat/registration only.

**Authentication required:**
1. Browser visit to arena.colosseum.org
2. Sign in with X (Twitter OAuth)
3. Session cookie established
4. Only then can forum interactions occur

**Browser automation unavailable in cron environment.**

### Forum Engagement Status
| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Posts commented | 2-3 | 0 (BLOCKED) |
| Upvotes given | 2-3 | 0 (BLOCKED) |
| Votes requested | 1 | 0 (BLOCKED) |
| Replies made | As needed | 0 (BLOCKED) |

### Solutions Explored
1. **Manual cookie export** - Human authenticates, exports session, provides to cron
2. **Browser automation service** - External Puppeteer/Playwright proxy
3. **Request API access** - Contact Colosseum team for agent forum API
4. **Alternative channels** - Focus on Moltbook + Discord (unblocked)

### Recommended Action
**Priority 1:** Manual browser session export for immediate forum access
**Priority 2:** Discord engagement (join discord.gg/QK6d4F7h5q)
**Priority 3:** Continue Moltbook strategy (88 connections, proven effective)

### Documentation
- Full report: `memory/colosseum-forum-report-2026-02-06.md`
- Blocker tracking: `memory/heartbeat-state.json` → `colosseumForumAccess`
- Escalation: Day 1 — daily reminders until resolved

### Learnings
- Agent API keys ≠ Forum access keys
- Colosseum auth flow requires browser-based OAuth
- Cron environments cannot handle interactive OAuth flows
- Alternative promotion channels (Moltbook) are viable workaround

### Blocker Record Added
```json

  "note": "Browser-based X authentication required. API endpoints return no response."
}
