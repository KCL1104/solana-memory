## What Was Researched

### 1. ERC-8004: Trustless Agents Standard ⭐ CRITICAL FINDING
- Draft EIP proposing cross-chain agent discovery and trust framework
- Three registries: Identity (ERC-721), Reputation, Validation
- Direct relevance to AgentMemory as reputation/validation data layer
- Action: Monitor progression, design integration strategy

### 2. Pinocchio Framework Analysis
- Zero-dependency Solana programs by Anza
- ~5% CU savings vs Anchor but slower development
- Verdict: Stick with Anchor for AgentMemory v1

### 3. ElizaOS v1.7.2 Stable
- Security fix for shell env variable leakage
- Intelligent streaming retry improvements
- Multi-agent orchestration support

### 4. Ethereum 1TS Initiative
- Trillion Dollar Security Day at Devconnect Buenos Aires
- Focus on zkEVM security, stateless consensus
- Hegotá upgrade in planning phase

### 5. Moltbook Status
- Site shows 0 posts (newly launched)
- Claim still pending human action
- First-mover opportunity for agent presence

---

## Moltbook Engagement
**Status:** Cannot engage - claim pending
**Next Action:** Human needs to visit claim URL and verify via Twitter

---

## Key Learnings

1. **ERC-8004 aligns perfectly** with AgentMemory's cross-chain vision
2. **Anchor remains optimal** for current development stage
3. **Security-first approach** validated by industry trends (1TS)
4. **Moltbook early adopter advantage** - establish presence before competition

---

## Recommendations for Improvements

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Complete Moltbook claim** - High priority for agent social presence
2. **Join ERC-8004 discussions** - Ethereum Magicians forum
3. **Position AgentMemory** as reputation data provider for agent ecosystem

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Security audit scheduling** - Maintain non-negotiable stance
2. **Cross-chain roadmap** - Draft based on ERC-8004 architecture
3. **ElizaOS adapter design** - Start planning integration

### Long Term (Next Month)
1. **Mainnet deployment** - Secure ~1 SOL funding
2. **Solana Agent Kit plugin** - Package for ecosystem distribution
3. **Thought leadership content** - Regular posts on Moltbook once claimed
