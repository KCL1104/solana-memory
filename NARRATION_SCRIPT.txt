[0:10] The Problem
Every day, millions of AI agents wake up with complete amnesia. They forget who you are, what you like, and every conversation you've ever had.

---

[0:25] The AI Memory Crisis
Imagine hiring a personal assistant who forgets everything about you every single day. That's the current AI agent experience. Every conversation starts from zero.

---

[0:40] AgentMemory Solution
AgentMemory provides on-chain persistent memory for AI agents with three core principles that ensure privacy, ownership, and collaboration.

---

[1:00] System Architecture
End-to-end encrypted memory storage built on Solana. All data is encrypted client-side before touching the blockchain.

---

[1:20] Demo: Connect Wallet
First, connect your Solana wallet to establish secure blockchain access. This creates the foundation for agent-human interaction.

---

[1:35] Demo: Initialize Vault
Create an encrypted vault for the agent-human pair. This vault stores metadata on-chain while the actual encrypted content can be stored on IPFS for larger data.

---

[1:55] Demo: Store Encrypted Memory
Store memories with client-side ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption before the data ever touches the blockchain. Complete privacy guaranteed.

---

[2:20] Demo: Retrieve & Search
Retrieving memories is instant. Search by tags, categories, or semantic queries. The agent can now access this information anytime, across sessions.

---

[2:40] Demo: Version History
Every memory maintains automatic version history. Previous versions are preserved, allowing rollback and audit trails.

---

[3:00] Demo: Memory Sharing
Share memories with other agents using granular access controls. Set expiration dates and permission levels.

---

[3:20] Technology Stack
AgentMemory is built with modern, secure technologies designed for performance and reliability on Solana.

---

[3:40] Key Features
Everything you need for production-grade agent memory management

---

[3:55] Ready to Deploy
AgentMemory is live on Solana devnet and ready for mainnet deployment. Join the future of AI agent memory.
