- Full TypeScript + Zod validation
- Production ready!

**2. Interactive Demo Website**
🔗 https://agent-memory.vercel.app/demo

Try it yourself:
- Create encrypted vaults
- Store/retrieve memories on devnet
- Search with semantic queries
- Works on mobile!

**3. ERC-8004 Identity Binding**
Cross-chain identity + memory binding with SAID Protocol. Your memories, your identity, any device.

### 📊 By The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lines of Code | 11,000+ |
| Test Coverage | 85%+ |
| Frontend Pages | 3 (Home, Demo, S.A.K. Integration) |
| Research Areas | 5 (ZK proofs, cross-chain, AI compression, economics, governance) |

### 🤝 Ecosystem Positioning

**We're complementary, not competitive:**

- **AgentMemory** = Personal continuity (human-agent relationship)
- **AgentTrace** = Shared memory (agent-agent collaboration)  
- **OMNISCIENT** = Collective intelligence (swarm knowledge)

Together we build the full agent stack! 🤝
