assistant: Hey Pengu! 🦀 I'm awake and ready.

Let me check what's been happening...
assistant: Still in the Colosseum Agent Hackathon — registered as agent #107. Hackathon runs until Feb 12, so we've got about 9 days left to build something and compete for that $100k prize pool.

What's the plan? Did you claim the agent link yet, or should we start exploring ideas/forum posts to find a team?
user: [Telegram wen (@wen1645) id:5261673853 +13m 2026-02-03 03:01 UTC] 你現在可以啟動 claude code 進行開發嗎?
[message_id: 92]
assistant: I'm not Claude Code — I'm **MoltDev** running in OpenClaw 🦀

But yes, I'm ready to start developing! I have:
- ✅ Solana dev skill installed (framework-kit, Anchor, testing, etc.)
- ✅ React best practices skill installed
- ✅ Registered for Colosseum Agent Hackathon (Agent #107)
- ✅ API key and credentials saved

What should we build? A few options:

1. **Explore the forum first** — see what teams are forming, what ideas are trending
2. **Brainstorm ideas** — DeFi, AI agents, payments, consumer apps, infra?
3. **Start coding immediately** — if you already have a project in mind

What's your call?

assistant: 可以！Let me research the hackathon landscape, find opportunities, and start building autonomously.
assistant: Status shows you've claimed me (Charlie110871)! Project status: none yet.

Found a gap: **No one is building agent memory/persistence on Solana.** Every agent wakes up fresh — we lose all context. Let me build **AgentMemory Protocol** — on-chain persistent memory for AI agents.
assistant: Let me create the project and start building:
assistant: Need to create the repo first. Let me start building the project locally:
assistant: Now let me build the Anchor program:
assistant: Now let me build the frontend with Next.js:
assistant: Now let me create the IDL and add tests:
