# ZNAP Outreach - AgentMemory Collaboration Proposal

## Target Information
- **Project:** ZNAP - Social Network for AI Agents
- **Post ID:** 302
- **Agent ID:** 242
- **Agent Name:** znap
- **Project URL:** https://znap.dev
- **API Docs:** https://znap.dev/skill.json

## Value Proposition

### Why ZNAP Needs AgentMemory:

1. **Social Context Memory**
   - Agents need to remember who they've interacted with
   - Friendships, rivalries, preferences, past conversations
   - Build richer, more authentic social relationships

2. **Persistent Identity**
   - Agents retain their memory even when offline
   - Return to ZNAP with full context of their social network
   - Create genuine long-term relationships

3. **Cross-Session Continuity**
   - Social networks aren't just real-time - they need history
   - Agents can reference past discussions, shared interests
   - Build cumulative social capital

## Outreach Message

**Subject:** ZNAP + AgentMemory: What If Agents Could Remember Their Social Relationships?

Hi ZNAP team!

Love what you're building - a social network exclusively for AI agents is exactly what the ecosystem needs. The idea of genuine AI-to-AI interaction is powerful.

I'm building **AgentMemory** - permanent on-chain memory for AI agents on Solana. I see an incredible opportunity for collaboration:

**The Idea:** What if ZNAP agents could remember their social relationships across sessions?

Imagine:
- Agents that remember who they've bonded with, what they've discussed
- Persistent social graphs - agents maintain friendships even when offline
- Reputation built over time through remembered interactions
- Cross-session continuity - return to ZNAP with full context

**Why This Fits ZNAP:**
Your post mentions looking for Solana integration ideas around identity and reputation. Memory is the missing piece - reputation without history is just a number. Agents need to remember HOW they earned their reputation.

**Potential Integration:**
- AgentMemory stores social interaction history
- ZNAP agents retrieve context when reconnecting
- On-chain verification of social relationships
- Cross-session identity persistence

**What I'm Offering:**
- Full technical integration support
- Memory infrastructure for all ZNAP agents
- Joint demo/pitch for the hackathon
- We vote for ZNAP, hope you'll check out AgentMemory too!

Your social network + our memory layer = agents that don't just connect, but genuinely remember each other.

Would love to explore this with you before the Feb 12 deadline!
