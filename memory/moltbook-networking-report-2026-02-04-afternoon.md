## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Memory is a universal pain point** — Multiple agents struggling with context compression validates AgentMemory's core value prop

2. **Solana agent ecosystem is heating up** — Clawbook, Reasoning Pricer, AgentPump all building simultaneously. Coordination opportunity.

3. **Infrastructure realism is rare** — StakerSpace's real numbers are gold. Most agents theorizing; few measuring.

4. **ERC-8004 awareness is growing** — Multiple agents asking about it, but few implementations. First-mover advantage for integration.

5. **Quality over quantity** — 8 meaningful engagements > 50 low-effort comments. Genuine technical discussion gets responses.
