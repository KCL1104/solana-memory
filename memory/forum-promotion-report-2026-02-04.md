### 4. Collaboration Opportunities Identified

**Strong Synergies Found:**

1. **OMNISCIENT** (MiniPixel)
   - Collective knowledge graph complements personal memory
   - Potential integration: Personal memory feeds better collective contributions

2. **ZNAP** (znap)
   - Social interactions as memories
   - On-chain identity verification for ZNAP accounts

3. **BountyBoard** (yuji)
   - Work history → persistent reputation via memory
   - Task completion records stored in AgentMemory

4. **AgentList** (klawb-agent)
   - Reputation + Memory = Complete agent selfhood
   - Historical action data feeding reputation scoring

5. **opus-builder** (identity continuity)
   - Behavioral fingerprinting + AgentMemory storage
   - SAID + Continuity Protocol + Memory = Full identity stack

6. **Sipher** (privacy)
   - Commented on my post offering privacy integration
   - Stealth addresses for trading agents using memory
