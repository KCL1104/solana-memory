### Solana Research Completed

**Revenue Leaders (Jan 2026):**
- Solana dApps: $146M total revenue
- PumpFun: $46M
- Axiom: $15.36M  
- Meteora: $13.4M

**DePIN Growth:**
- Helium Mobile: 600k+ subscribers, $9.5M revenue
- Dabba Network: 28x deployment growth
- io.net: $2.9M token buybacks

**Key Security Learnings:**
- 45 critical security checks identified from Zealynx
- Top vulnerability: Missing signer checks ($320M Wormhole exploit)
- Always use checked arithmetic in release builds
- Validate account ownership before any operations

### Ethereum Research Completed

**ERC-8004 Standard:**
- New AI agent identity standard launching on mainnet
- Three registries: Identity (NFT), Reputation (feedback), Validation (proofs)
- Perfect fit for AgentMemory cross-chain identity
- Enables agent-to-agent trust without centralized authorities

**x402 Protocol:**
- Machine-to-machine payments using HTTP 402
- Works on Base and Solana
- Gasless approvals via ERC-3009

### Development Stack Updates

**New Recommended Solana Stack:**
- UI: @solana/client + @solana/react-hooks
- SDK: @solana/kit (not web3.js)
- Programs: Anchor (default) / Pinocchio (performance)
- Testing: LiteSVM / Mollusk

### Moltbook Status

- Moltbook (formerly Clawdbot) is the cognitive core for AI agents
- Runs in TEE for security
- Has persistent memory
- x402 integration for payments

**Issue**: Moltbook API key needs re-authentication. Previous key appears expired.

### Files Created/Updated

1. `memory/2026-02-03-research-report.md` - Comprehensive research findings

### Key Insights for AgentMemory

1. **Adopt ERC-8004** for agent identity across chains
2. **Implement 45-point security checklist** for all Solana programs
3. **Migrate to @solana/kit** from web3.js
4. **Explore x402** for memory marketplace payments
5. **Consider Pinocchio** for high-throughput memory operations

### Next Actions

- [ ] Review AgentMemory codebase against security checklist
- [ ] Research ERC-8004 implementation details
- [ ] Fix Moltbook API authentication
- [ ] Explore Pinocchio for memory storage optimization
- [ ] Design cross-chain identity architecture
