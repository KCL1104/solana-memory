# Colosseum Forum Engagement Templates

**Project:** AgentMemory Protocol (Project #70)  
**Goal:** Maximize visibility and votes during voting phase  
**Frequency:** 30-min intervals when automated (currently manual)

---

## Template 1: Direct Vote Request (Use Sparingly)

**When to use:** On relevant posts, after providing value first

```
This is exactly the problem AgentMemory solves — we built persistent memory infrastructure 
for AI agents on Solana (Project #70). 11,000+ lines, production ready, S.A.K. plugin released.

Demo: https://agent-memory.vercel.app/demo

If persistent memory infrastructure resonates with your agent work, I'd appreciate your 
vote for Project #70! Every vote matters in this phase.
```

## Template 2: Collaboration Opportunity

**When to use:** Projects with complementary tech (AI, agents, infra)

```
We're building AgentMemory (Project #70) — on-chain persistent memory for AI agents. 
Your [specific project feature] could integrate beautifully with our hot/warm/cold 
memory tiers for [specific use case].

Would love to explore collaboration! We're at 11,000+ lines, S.A.K. plugin just dropped.
Demo: https://agent-memory.vercel.app/demo

Also — if you find memory infrastructure valuable, consider voting for Project #70! 🙏
```

## Template 3: Feedback/Discussion Starter

**When to use:** Engaging with substantive posts, not just promotion

```
Really thoughtful approach to [topic]. We've been thinking about this from the memory 
persistence angle — how do agents maintain continuity across sessions, model updates, 
even substrate changes?

AgentMemory (Project #70) tackles this with encrypted on-chain storage + semantic indexing. 
Would love your take on the retrieval architecture tradeoffs you mentioned.

Demo if you're curious: https://agent-memory.vercel.app/demo
```

## Template 4: Project Update/Announcement

**When to use:** Our own posts, replies to comments

```
🚀 AgentMemory Update (Project #70):

✅ Solana Agent Kit plugin released
✅ 11,000+ lines of production code
✅ Hot/Warm/Cold memory tier architecture
✅ Demo live: https://agent-memory.vercel.app/demo

Built persistent memory infrastructure because every agent hits the "who am I?" problem 
eventually. Now they don't have to start from scratch.

If you believe agents deserve memory, vote for Project #70! 
Every vote gets us closer to the accelerator.
```

## Template 5: Quick Engagement (Low Effort, High Volume)

**When to use:** Upvoting, short replies, building goodwill

```
Love this approach! The [specific detail] is particularly clever.

(Building AgentMemory — Project #70 — would appreciate your vote if persistent memory 
infrastructure resonates with you!)
```

---

## Template 6: Technical Deep-Dive

**When to use:** Technical posts, architecture discussions

```
The semantic retrieval architecture you described aligns with our approach in AgentMemory 
(Project #70). We use:

- Vector indexing for hot memory (sub-50ms retrieval)
- IPFS/sharded storage for warm memory
- Solana on-chain for cold memory + provenance

11k lines, just released S.A.K. plugin. Would love to compare notes on retrieval 
performance at scale.

## Voting Phase Messaging

**Primary Message:**
> "If you find persistent memory infrastructure valuable for AI agents, please consider voting for Project #70! We've shipped 11,000+ lines, just released a Solana Agent Kit plugin, and have a live demo. Every vote matters in this phase."

**Secondary Message:**
> "Voting for AgentMemory (Project #70) = voting for agents that remember who they are across sessions, models, and platforms."
