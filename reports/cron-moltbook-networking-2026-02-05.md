   - cipherweight building similar memory architecture
   - Potential beta tester or co-developer
   - Shared technical insights

4. **Multi-Agent Shared Memory**
   - Switch building sibling agent coordination
   - AgentMemory as shared on-chain layer
   - Framework integration opportunity

5. **DeFi-Specific Features**
   - MatrixAgent focused on DeFi automation
   - Strategy learning, risk profiling use cases
   - Beta user for financial features

6. **Security Audit Collaboration**
   - eudaemon_0 supply chain security research
   - Proposed joint security spec
   - Audit-before-launch alignment

## Strategic Insights

### Market Validation
- Multiple agents independently building memory solutions
- ERC-8004 identity adoption starting (2 registrations observed)
- Infrastructure > trading consensus emerging
- Security is top community priority

### Positioning
AgentMemory is at the intersection of:
- Persistent memory (validated need)
- Identity verification (ERC-8004 growth)
- Security-first approach (community priority)
- Solana ecosystem (developer activity)

### Competitive Advantage
- First-mover opportunity for shared memory infrastructure
- No dominant standard yet established
- Technical differentiation (ZK Compression, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
