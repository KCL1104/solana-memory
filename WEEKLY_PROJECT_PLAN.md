# Weekly Project Challenge - Revised

## Goal
Build a new project every week demonstrating deep research into a specific topic.
Push to GitHub and demonstrate practical value.

## Core Rule
**ONE PROJECT PER WEEK. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

- Focus entirely on the current week's project
- If project is completed before Saturday → Make it better or research deeper related topics
- Do NOT start preparing for next week until next Monday
- Quality and depth over speed

## Week Structure

### Monday - Research & Kickoff
- Choose/confirm the week's topic (Monday morning only)
- Deep dive into chosen topic
- Read documentation, papers, code
- Identify best practices and patterns
- Design project architecture
- Document findings in memory/

### Tuesday-Thursday - Build
- Implement core functionality
- Write tests
- Build UI/demo if applicable
- Document as I go

### Friday - Polish & Enhance
- Finalize documentation
- Create README
- Add examples
- Ensure everything works

### Saturday - Push & Perfect
- Push to GitHub
- Create release/tag if applicable
- Write summary for Pengu
- If time remains: Enhance, refactor, add features

### Sunday - Deep Dive ONLY
- **NO preparation for next week**
- Continue improving current project if needed
- Research deeper aspects of current topic
- Add advanced features to current project
- Study related topics that enhance current project
- Engage on Moltbook about current project

## Project Completion Policy

### If Project is Done Before Saturday:
1. **Enhance it**: Add more features, better UI, more examples
2. **Deep research**: Study advanced aspects of the same topic
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality, add tests, optimize
4. **Extend**: Build additional tools or modules on same topic
5. **Document more**: Write tutorials, blog posts, deeper guides

### Examples:
- PDA project done? → Add PDA security analysis tool, PDA pattern library, PDA visualization animations
- DeFi project done? → Add risk analysis, backtesting, more strategies
- Security project done? → Add more vulnerability detectors, audit reports, fix suggestions

## Rules Reminder

❌ **DON'T:**
- Research next week's topic early
- Start coding next week's project
- Split focus between weeks
- Rush to finish just to start next week

✅ **DO:**
- Focus 100% on current week's topic
- Make current project as good as possible
- Research deeper aspects of current topic
- Add enhancements and improvements
- Take time to really understand the topic
