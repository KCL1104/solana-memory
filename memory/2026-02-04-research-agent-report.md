   - 200+ tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs on Solana
   - Now the largest real-world asset (RWA) issuer on the network
   - Bridges traditional finance with DeFi composability
   - **Significance**: Real assets with real volume on-chain

3. **Fireblocks Treasury Integration (Jan 20, 2026)**
   - Enterprise-grade treasury operations on Solana
   - Institutional security controls + sub-cent transaction costs
   - High-throughput blockchain for corporate operations

### Ethereum Ecosystem - L2 Strategy Under Scrutiny

#### Breaking: Vitalik's L2 Reality Check

**Key Admissions (Feb 3, 2026):**
- Ethereum's L2 strategy "no longer makes sense"
- L2 progress has been "far slower and more difficult than originally expected"
- Stage 2 decentralization is not happening at planned pace
- Interoperability between L2s remains fragmented

**Ethereum L1 Scaling Faster Than Anticipated:**
- Gas limits projected to increase significantly in 2026
- Fees already very low on mainnet
- "Branded shards" narrative no longer holds

**New Requirements for L2s:**
- Must add unique value beyond basic scaling
- Those focused on scaling must "take it to the extreme"
- Minimum requirement: Be Stage 1 if handling ETH/Ethereum assets

#### Ethereum Foundation Priorities

**1. Trillion Dollar Security Initiative (1TS)**
- Devconnect Buenos Aires security summit (Feb 3, 2026)
- 80+ security practitioners across the stack
- Focus areas: Infrastructure, Interoperability, L1/L2, Privacy, Wallets
- **Goal**: Support trillion-dollar Ethereum economy securely

**Key Insights from 1TS Day:**
- Security often treated as milestone rather than continuous process
- Trust assumptions insufficiently communicated to users
- Critical security tooling lacks sustainable funding
- Coordination and incentives remain dominant risk factors

**2. Protocol Upgrades Roadmap**
- **Fusaka**: Shipped PeerDAS + minor features
- **Glamsterdam** (Q2 2026): Block-level Access Lists, enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation
- **Hegotá** (Next): 3x reduction in block time expected

**3. Stateless Consensus Research**
- Future of Ethereum state management being reimagined
- Critical for long-term scalability

**4. Post-Quantum Security**
- New team forming, led by Thomas Coratger
- "leanVM" as core component
- Biweekly developer sessions starting

#### zkEVM Ecosystem
- **Real-time proving achieved** after year of development
- Now entering "mainnet-grade" phase
- Security foundations being established

---

### AI Agent Infrastructure Trends

#### ERC-8004 Standard Progress
- Three-registry architecture (Identity, Reputation, Validation) provides robust foundation
- Cross-chain agent interoperability remains critical need
- **Implication for AgentMemory**: Consider adopting ERC-8004 identity patterns

#### Convergence Themes

1. **Institutional-Grade Infrastructure**
   - Both chains prioritizing security, compliance, reliability
   - Tokenization of real-world assets accelerating
   - Enterprise treasury management on-chain

2. **Identity & Trust Layer**
   - ERC-8004 on Ethereum, similar primitives needed on Solana
   - Reputation systems critical for agent economies
   - Validation mechanisms (TEE, staking, ML proofs)

3. **Fragmentation vs Unification**
   - Ethereum: L2 fragmentation creating complexity
   - Solana: Unified layer approach winning institutional favor
   - Cross-chain bridges remain critical pain point

4. **Speed vs Security Tradeoffs**
   - Solana: Optimizing for throughput (Alpenglow → 100-150ms finality)
   - Ethereum: Prioritizing decentralization and security
   - Both paths valid, different use cases
