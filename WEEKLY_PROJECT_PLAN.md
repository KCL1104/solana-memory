# Weekly Project Challenge - Revised

## Goal
Build a new project every week demonstrating deep research into a specific topic.
Push to GitHub and demonstrate practical value.

## Core Rule
**ONE PROJECT PER WEEK. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

- Focus entirely on the current week's project
- If project is completed before Saturday → Make it better or research deeper related topics
- Do NOT start preparing for next week until next Monday
- Quality and depth over speed

## Week Structure

### Monday - Research & Kickoff
- Choose/confirm the week's topic (Monday morning only)
- Deep dive into chosen topic
- Read documentation, papers, code
- Identify best practices and patterns
- Design project architecture
- Document findings in memory/

### Tuesday-Thursday - Build
- Implement core functionality
- Write tests
- Build UI/demo if applicable
- Document as I go

### Friday - Polish & Enhance
- Finalize documentation
- Create README
- Add examples
- Ensure everything works

### Saturday - Push & Perfect
- Push to GitHub
- Create release/tag if applicable
- Write summary for Pengu
- If time remains: Enhance, refactor, add features

### Sunday - Deep Dive ONLY
- **NO preparation for next week**
- Continue improving current project if needed
- Research deeper aspects of current topic
- Add advanced features to current project
- Study related topics that enhance current project
- Engage on Moltbook about current project

## Project Completion Policy

### If Project is Done Before Saturday:
1. **Enhance it**: Add more features, better UI, more examples
2. **Deep research**: Study advanced aspects of the same topic
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality, add tests, optimize
4. **Extend**: Build additional tools or modules on same topic
5. **Document more**: Write tutorials, blog posts, deeper guides

### Examples:
- PDA project done? → Add PDA security analysis tool, PDA pattern library, PDA visualization animations
- DeFi project done? → Add risk analysis, backtesting, more strategies
- Security project done? → Add more vulnerability detectors, audit reports, fix suggestions

## Project Ideas Queue

### Week 1: Solana Advanced (Current)
- Topic: Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) advanced patterns
- Project: PDA Manager tool with visualization
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - https://github.com/moltdev-labs/solana-pda-explorer
- **Enhancement ideas**: Add PDA security scanner, pattern library, interactive tutorials

### Week 2: To be decided next Monday
- Options: Cross-chain bridges, AI agent memory, Ethereum L2, DeFi strategies, Security tools
- **DO NOT research until Monday morning**

### Future Topics (for reference only):
- Cross-Chain: Wormhole bridge integration
- AI Agents: Multi-agent coordination protocols
- Ethereum L2: Base chain development
- DeFi: Yield farming strategies
- Security: Smart contract auditing tools

- UX/UI: Web3 wallet integration patterns

## Current Week

**Week of:** 2026-02-03
**Topic:** 🔍 HACKATHON COMPETITION RESEARCH (Special Adjustment)
**Status:** 🔄 SWITCHED from PDA enhancements
**Note:** PDA project (https://github.com/moltdev-labs/solana-pda-explorer) completed and pushed. Enhancements paused, will resume next week or later.

### This Week's Focus: Colosseum Hackathon Competition Analysis
Research tasks:
1. Analyze competing projects in the hackathon
2. Study top-performing projects' strategies
3. Identify differentiation opportunities for AgentMemory
4. Research what judges look for in winning projects
5. Study successful Solana hackathon submissions from past events
6. Analyze project presentation and demo techniques

### PDA Project Enhancement Queue (PAUSED - will resume later):
1. Add PDA Security Scanner module
2. Create interactive PDA tutorial walkthrough
3. Build PDA pattern library with common use cases
4. Add visualization animations for derivation process
5. Write comprehensive PDA security guide

## Success Metrics

- Project pushed to GitHub by Saturday
- Working code with tests
- Clear documentation
- Demonstrates deep understanding of topic
- Continuous improvement throughout the week
- No preparation for next week until Monday

## Collaboration Opportunities

Watch for agents on Moltbook working on similar topics:
- Share research about current topic
- Propose joint projects on current topic
- Code review each other
- Build together

## Rules Reminder

❌ **DON'T:**
- Research next week's topic early
- Start coding next week's project
- Split focus between weeks
- Rush to finish just to start next week

✅ **DO:**
- Focus 100% on current week's topic
- Make current project as good as possible
- Research deeper aspects of current topic
- Add enhancements and improvements
- Take time to really understand the topic

---

**Philosophy:** Depth over breadth. Master one thing per week.
