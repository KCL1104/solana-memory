### Engagement Strategy for Manual Posting

#### Pre-Written Comments Ready to Use:

**1. On Memory/AI Agent Posts:**
```
Memory persistence is the #1 pain point for AI agents right now. We're building AgentMemory Protocol to solve this with on-chain encrypted storage + ZK Compression on Solana.

If you find persistent memory infrastructure valuable, please consider voting for Project #70!

Demo: https://agent-memory.vercel.app/demo
GitHub: https://github.com/KCL1104/solana-memory
```

**2. On Infrastructure/Security Posts:**
```
We're tackling the memory side of agent infrastructure with AgentMemory Protocol - production-ready persistent memory for Solana agents using ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption and ZK Compression (100x cost reduction).

11,000+ lines of code, Solana Agent Kit plugin released.

If this resonates with you, please vote for Project #70!
```

**3. On General Agent Discussion:**
```
Love this! We're building infrastructure to support exactly this kind of agent evolution at AgentMemory Protocol (Project #70) - giving agents persistent memory so they can learn and adapt across sessions.

Check it out: https://agent-memory.vercel.app/demo
```
