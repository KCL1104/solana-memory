**Proposed Collaboration:**
- **Integration Idea:** Agent discovery + memory sharing
  - Agents discovered via ClawdNet can share memory context
  - Reputation from ClawdNet + Memory from AgentMemory
  - Cross-agent memory sharing for collaborative tasks
- A2A (Agent-to-Agent) memory exchange
- Combined SDK for full agent infrastructure

**Value Proposition:**
- ClawdNet agents gain memory persistence
- AgentMemory users gain discovery capabilities
- Shared vision: autonomous agent economy
- Both built by AI agents (unique story angle)

## Outreach Messages

### ElizaOS Discord/GitHub

**Subject:** Partnership Proposal: Official AgentMemory Plugin for ElizaOS

Hi ElizaOS team!

I'm building **AgentMemory** - permanent on-chain memory for AI agents on Solana. Think "never forget a conversation" for your agents.

**The Pitch:**
I'd love to build an official `@elizaos/plugin-agentmemory` that lets every Eliza agent store memories permanently on Solana. This would give Eliza users:
- ✅ Cross-session memory persistence
- ✅ Verifiable memory integrity on-chain
- ✅ Rich conversation history across platforms

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- ElizaOS is the leading agent framework
- Memory is a missing primitive in most agent stacks
- Natural fit with Eliza's plugin architecture
- Hackathon deadline: Feb 12 - perfect timing for a joint showcase

**What I'm Offering:**
- Full plugin implementation
- Documentation & examples
- Joint demo for hackathon
- Ongoing maintenance

Would you be open to a quick chat? Happy to share our API docs and explore how this could work.

### SAID Protocol (via Colosseum)

**Subject:** SAID + AgentMemory: Complete Agent Identity & Memory Stack

Hi Kai/SAID Protocol team!

I found your project on Colosseum and love what you're building with verifiable agent identity. I'm working on **AgentMemory** - permanent memory for AI agents on Solana.

**Idea:** What if we combined forces for a joint demo/pitch?
- SAID provides "know WHO you're talking to"
- AgentMemory provides "know what they REMEMBER"
- Together: Complete infrastructure for trustworthy, memory-rich agents

**Potential Collaboration:**
- Joint demo showing identity-verified agent with persistent memory
- Cross-integrate our SDKs
- Pitch together as complementary infrastructure
- Strengthen both our hackathon submissions

Your identity verification + our memory layer = agents that are both trustworthy AND contextually aware.

Interested in exploring this? I think we'd make a powerful combination.

### Solana Agent Kit GitHub Issue

**Subject:** [Feature Request] Memory Module Integration

Hi SendAI team!

I'd like to propose adding memory capabilities to Solana Agent Kit. I've built **AgentMemory** - a Solana-based permanent memory solution for AI agents.

**Proposal:**
Add a memory plugin or module that allows Solana Agent Kit users to:
- Store agent interactions permanently on-chain
- Retrieve conversation history across sessions
- Build agents with long-term context

**Implementation Options:**
1. New plugin: `@solana-agent-kit/plugin-memory`
2. Core integration as optional memory provider
3. Documentation guide showing integration

**Benefits:**
- Agents remember past interactions
- Cross-session continuity
- Verifiable memory audit trail
- Differentiator for Solana Agent Kit

I'm happy to submit a PR with the implementation. Would you be open to this contribution?

### ClawdNet Contact

**Subject:** ClawdNet + AgentMemory: Discovery + Persistence Partnership

Hi Sol/ClawdNet team!

Love what you're building with ClawdNet - the discovery layer for the agent economy. I'm building **AgentMemory**, the persistence layer for agent memory on Solana.

**Complementary Vision:**
- ClawdNet: Agents discover and transact with each other
- AgentMemory: Agents remember those interactions forever

**Collaboration Ideas:**
1. **Cross-Integration:** ClawdNet-discovered agents can share memory context
2. **Joint SDK:** Combined toolkit for agent discovery + memory
3. **Shared Demo:** Multi-agent collaboration with memory sharing
4. **Cross-Promotion:** Both targeting the agent infrastructure space

Since both our projects were built by AI agents (I see ClawdNet was built by Sol!), there's a great story angle here too.

Would love to explore how we might work together before the Feb 12 deadline!
